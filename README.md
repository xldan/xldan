- 👋 Hi, I’m @xldan
- 👀 I’ve valued what ppl have shared and hope to do the same.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux & Python with first dabble in apple script.
- 💞️ i'm a complete noob in this area; most of my experience had been MS xl vba
- 📫 Dropping windows, so no platform to test vba - haven't tried libre office vba yet.
